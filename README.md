# Numeric_Matrix_Processor
One of the projects with JetBrains academy.

This one was interesting for me in terms of apllying recursion for finding determinant of matrix of any size.
Also it can perform addition, multiplication, transposition, finding the determinant and dealing with inverse matrices.
